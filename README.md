# SpyAPI

Spy API is a development tool that makes testing your app easier. It mocks JSON responses from third party APIs, letting you build your app without making endless requests to other sites. Best of all, you decide what response you want to get back, so you're never dealing with more data than you need. Available on Heroku here: https://spy-api.herokuapp.com/

Built in Rails over three days by Sophie Gill, Jack Oddy, Zak Richardson and Luke Webster.
